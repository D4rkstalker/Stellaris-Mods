 trait_robot: "Robot"
 trait_robot_desc: "Cheap and quick to build, Robots are mindless machines designed to take over £pop_cat_worker£ §Y$pop_cat_worker$ Jobs§!.§!\n\nTheir specialized design allows them to be quite efficient at their job."
 trait_android: "Droid"
 trait_android_desc: "Built with advanced servomotors and a powerful CPU, Droids are packaged with pre-programmed personalities and the hardware to perform complex tasks. \n\nAs they posses no true intelligence of their own, they are only capable of relatively simple £pop_cat_specialist£ §Y$pop_cat_specialist$ Jobs§!.§!\n\nTheir complex circuitry allows them to be fairly capable at many tasks, however they are somewhat delicate, making them more vulnerable compared to their simpler counterparts."
 trait_synthetic: "Synthetic"
 trait_synthetic_desc: "Highly complex machines, Synthetics are built with positronic brains, enabling them to perform complex £pop_cat_specialist£ §Y$pop_cat_specialist$ Jobs§! such as £job_researcher£ §YResearch§!.\n\nWhile their processors are theoretically cabaple of supporting a class-7 artificial intelligence, these robots are not programmed with one and cannot take up £pop_cat_ruler£ $pop_cat_ruler$ Jobs§! nor can they become leaders.§!\n\nThese machines are specialized towards more computational tasks and lack the raw mechanical strength of their lesser relatives."
 trait_advanced_synthetic: "Class-7 Synthetic"
 trait_advanced_synthetic_desc: "A synthetic chassis programmed with a class-7 artificial intelligence, these machines are fully self-aware and can perform all jobs and take up leadership roles.\nIf it were not for their mechanical exteriors, these machines would be indestinguishable from sapient organics.§!\n\nThe positronic brains of these units are specifically tweaks for leadership roles"
 trait_overhual_tech_1: "Chassis Module Expansion: Tier 1"
 trait_overhual_tech_1_desc: "Advanced engineering and assembly techniques allows miniaturizing of a robot's core components, making room for more modules.§!\nThe added manufacturing complexity makes each unit slower and pricier to build."
 trait_overhual_combat_1: "Combat Expansion Module: Tier 1"
 trait_overhual_combat_1_desc: "Each unit comes pre-programmed with a full suite of combat knowledge, making them fearsome soldiers and leaders.§!\nCan generate leaders with the §BCombat Programming§! trait."
 trait_overhual_shield_1: "Shield Module: Tier 1"
 trait_overhual_shield_1_desc: "Personel shields provieds increased survivability to individual units as well as reducing maintenance.§!\nCan generate leaders with the §BCombat Shield Uplink§! trait."
 trait_overhual_missile_1: "Missile Hardpoints: Tier 1"
 trait_overhual_missile_1_desc: "Missile hardpoints bolted onto the chassis provides a powerful combat advantage.§!\nCan generate leaders with the §BMissile Control Module§! trait."
 trait_overhual_strikecraft_1: "Swarm Controller: Tier 1"
 trait_overhual_strikecraft_1_desc: "Specialized multi-core prossors allows each unit to simultaniously manage large swarms of drones.§!\nCan generate leaders with the §BStrikecraft Command§! trait."
 trait_overhual_radar_1: "Enhanced Sensor Suite: Tier 1"
 trait_overhual_radar_1_desc: "Enhanced sensor suites enabled units to process a wider range of information.§!\nCan generate leaders with the §BEnhanced Sensors§! trait."
 trait_overhual_coordination_1: "Improved Coordination Routines: Tier 1"
 trait_overhual_coordination_1_desc: "Meshed network connection adaptors allows for connection to nearby units, improving unit coordination.§!\nCan generate leaders with the §BCommand and Control§! trait."
 trait_overhual_fabrication_1: "Advanced Fabrication: Tier 1"
 trait_overhual_fabrication_1_desc: "Overhualed chassis designs allows for faster unit assembly.§!\nCan generate leaders with the §BConstructor§! trait."
 trait_overhual_gateway_1: "Short Range Teleporter: Tier 1"
 trait_overhual_gateway_1_desc: "Short range personel teleporter allows unparalled personel transportation.§!\nCan generate leaders with the §BHyper Nagivators§! trait."
 trait_overhual_jamming_1: "Jamming Arrays: Tier 1"
 trait_overhual_jamming_1_desc: "Jamming Arrays improves individual survivability of combat units.§!\nCan generate leaders with the §BElectronic Countermeasures§! trait."
 trait_overhual_resource_basic_1: "Basic Resource Allocation System: Tier 1"
 trait_overhual_resource_basic_1_desc: "The robot's hardware and software has been configured to produce basic resources."
